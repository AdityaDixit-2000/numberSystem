## In this project I created two main files of JS.
## index.js and app.js :
## index.js : In this file I write code for indentying is number is even or odd
## app.js : In this file I write code for extracting all prime numbers from given array
##      then perform some operations on that array.

### Expeted outputs of codes are :
#### primeArray = [ 19, 23, 13, 31, 29, 2, 11, 17, 5 ],
#### minPrime = 2, maxPrime = 31 and sumPrimes = 150.
